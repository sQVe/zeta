# ADR 0014: Results for expected failures, exceptions for bugs, and checked boundaries

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-03

## Context

- The session runs refreshes, actions, and cache writes while the UI stays responsive. One failure
  must never stop the session.
- Data enters from `gh` output, config, the state file, and the cache. None of it can be trusted
  until it is parsed.
- Agents write much of the code, so the conventions must be explicit and easy to check in review.
- A few values own resources that must be released exactly once, such as the SQLite handle, a child
  process, or the renderer. Everything else is data and functions over it.
- Every runtime dependency ships to every user. A version range would let a rebuild pick up new
  dependency code that nobody reviewed.
- Phi makes the same choices for the same reasons, and [ADR 0010](./0010-shared-project-base.md)
  keeps shared decisions in line.

## Options considered

- Exceptions for every failure. Rejected: callers cannot see from a signature which failures to
  expect, and a missed catch can stop the session.
- Typed results for every failure, bugs included. Rejected: impossible states would spread checks
  through every caller, and a bug would read like an expected outcome.
- Assertions that run only in development builds. Rejected: a broken state in a release would go on
  silently and fail later, far from its cause.
- Add packages freely with version ranges. Rejected: each package adds size and supply-chain risk,
  and a range can change shipped code without review.
- Classes as the main unit of code, with inheritance for shared behavior. Rejected: state and
  behavior mix, so code is harder to test without real resources, and base classes couple unrelated
  modules.
- Typed results for expected failures, exceptions for bugs, always-on invariants, and parsing at
  every boundary. Chosen: expected failures are part of each signature, and bugs fail where they
  happen.

## Decision

Expected failures return typed results, and bugs throw. Zeta parses untrusted data once, at the
boundary, with zod.

### Errors

- A function that can fail in an expected way returns a typed result with a reason. A failed `gh`
  call, a rate limit, a missing tool, and a corrupt file are expected failures.
- Throw only for bugs. The session catches per refresh and per action, so one failure shows an error
  and never stops the session.
- `invariant(condition, message)` checks states that must be impossible. It runs in every build.
  Never use it to check input.
- `invariant.ts` is a flat module that imports no other module. Every module may import it.
- Code in `src/` throws only inside `invariant.ts`. Test files are exempt.

### Boundaries

- Parse `gh` output, config, the state file, and cache rows with zod, once, where they enter. Pass
  trusted types inward.
- Ids are branded types, such as the subject identity. Each has one constructor and is parsed at the
  boundary.

### State and classes

- Code is pure and immutable by default.
- Use a class only for a resource Zeta owns that needs a dispose step, such as the SQLite handle or
  an OpenTUI renderable.
- Do not use inheritance, except where OpenTUI requires it.
- OpenTUI subclasses use OpenTUI's lifecycle and need no dispose method.

### Names

- Name files and folders in camelCase. A file named after the React component or class it exports
  may use PascalCase, such as `StatusBar.tsx`.

### Dependencies

- Prefer Bun built-ins to packages.
- Add a runtime dependency only with a stated reason. A core dependency needs an ADR.
- Pin every dependency to an exact version.

## Tradeoffs

- A caller sees each expected failure in the type and must handle it.
- A bug fails where it happens, in every build, and stops only its refresh or action.
- Code inside the boundary trusts its types and needs no defensive checks.
- Cost: results add code at every call that can fail.
- Cost: always-on invariants run in release builds, so they must stay cheap.
- Cost: zod is a runtime dependency that every boundary relies on.
- Cost: behavior that would sit on a class lives in module functions, so a reader finds a value's
  operations by its module, not its type.
