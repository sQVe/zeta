# ADR 0009: Versioned local state and config

- Status: Superseded by [ADR 0018](./0018-local-state-and-config.md)
- Date: 2026-10-01

## Context

- Zeta saves dismissals between runs and reads a user config with key remaps and repository
  locations.
- A crash during a write, a corrupt file, or an older Zeta reading a newer file must not destroy
  saved data.
- In Tau, a parse-once rule still produced four parsers for one value. Each file needs one parser
  owner.
- Zeta runs as one process per user. No use case needs two sessions writing one state file.

## Options considered

- Unversioned JSON. Rejected: a reader cannot tell an older format from a newer one.
- Start with empty state and overwrite a file that fails to parse. Rejected: it silently destroys
  saved dismissals.
- A database such as SQLite. Rejected: one small file per user needs no query engine.
- Locks or merging for several writers. Deferred: no second-session use case exists.
- Versioned JSON files with one parser each and atomic writes. Chosen: each file has one owner, a
  version, and a write that cannot leave half a file.

## Decision

Config and local state are versioned JSON files, parsed once at startup by their owning module.

### Files

- Config lives at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zeta/config.json` and falls back to
  `~/.config/zeta/config.json`. `config.ts` parses it. Zeta never writes it.
- State lives at `$XDG_STATE_HOME/zeta/state.json` and falls back to
  `~/.local/state/zeta/state.json`. `localState.ts` parses and writes it.
- Each file has a `version` field. Code past the parser receives typed values only.

### Reading

- A missing file means defaults.
- Invalid config stops startup with the path and the reason.
- Invalid state shows a warning. Zeta runs without saved dismissals and does not write that file
  until the user resets it.
- An older version migrates forward in memory. State is saved in the current version on the next
  write.
- A version newer than Zeta knows stops startup.

### Writing

- Zeta writes state to a unique temporary file beside the target, flushes and closes it, then
  renames it over the target. A failed write keeps the last valid file.
- Writes run one at a time. A dismissal takes effect in memory at once and shows as unsaved until a
  write succeeds.
- One Zeta process writes a state file. Concurrent processes can lose each other's dismissals.

### Compatibility

- Each format change bumps the version and adds a migration with fixture tests.
- Ask the user before any change that breaks an existing config or state file.

## Tradeoffs

- Saved dismissals survive crashes, corrupt files, and older versions.
- Every format change has a version and a tested migration.
- Cost: users must add a `version` field to their config.
- Cost: running two Zeta processes at once can lose dismissals.
- Cost: invalid state needs a manual reset before Zeta saves dismissals again.
