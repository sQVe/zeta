## Context

Zeta needs notifications, plus review requests, review decisions, check status, and mergeability for
pull requests across many repositories in each refresh.

`gh search prs --json` does not return check status or mergeability. `gh pr list --json` returns
them, but for one repository at a time.

One GraphQL search query can return all of these pull request fields in one request. A test query
for one account returned 59 pull requests for 2 of the usual 5,000 points per hour.

GraphQL has no notifications field. Notifications come only from the REST `GET /notifications`
endpoint.

Users already sign in with `gh`, which stores the token, picks the host, and switches accounts. A
token that Zeta keeps from startup misses a later `gh auth switch`.

## Decision

Zeta reads and writes GitHub by running `gh api`. Searches use one batched GraphQL query, and
notifications use one REST call. `gh` owns authentication, the host, and the active account, and
Zeta adds no dependency.

### Requests

- Pull request searches and subject details run as one batched `gh api graphql` query per refresh,
  plus one per extra page.
- Notifications use `gh api /notifications`, one call per page.
- Zeta never reads, stores, or passes a GitHub token. `gh` finds it, so `GH_TOKEN` and
  `gh auth switch` work as they do for `gh`.
- `gh` is a required tool. Zeta reports a clear error when `gh` is missing or not signed in.
- Each request starts a new `gh` process, so it uses the account that is active at that time.
- Every call runs with `--include`. Zeta reads the HTTP status and headers, and the GraphQL `errors`
  field, instead of the exit code. GraphQL can report a rate limit with HTTP 200, and `gh` exits 1
  on a 304 Not Modified.

### Ownership

- Only the `github` module builds requests and parses their results. It passes plain work data to
  the rest of Zeta, so the transport can change without touching other modules.
- Actions that change GitHub, such as marking a notification read, also run `gh api` through the
  `github` module.

## Consequences

### Positive

- A refresh costs few processes and requests, at a small point cost.
- Zeta has no token handling, no host config, and no HTTP client dependency.

### Negative

- Zeta does not work without `gh` installed and signed in.
- Errors arrive as status lines, headers, and response text, which Zeta must parse, instead of typed
  HTTP errors.
- Zeta owns its GraphQL query and must follow GitHub schema deprecations.
- Cancellation kills the `gh` process instead of aborting a request.

## Alternatives considered

### `gh pr list` and `gh search prs`

Run `gh pr list` and `gh search prs` with `--json`. Rejected because one refresh needs a search plus
a process for each pull request or repository to fill in the missing fields.

### Bun `fetch`

Send requests with Bun `fetch` and a token from `gh auth token`. Rejected because Zeta would handle
tokens and hosts itself. It would gain little because a refresh sends few requests, and `gh` stays
required for the token.

### Octokit

Use Octokit. Rejected because it adds dependencies for a few requests that `gh` or `fetch` already
sends.
