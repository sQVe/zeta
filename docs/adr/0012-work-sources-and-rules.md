# ADR 0012: Sources find candidates, local rules decide why

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-03

## Context

- Zeta shows GitHub work that needs action, with every reason for each item. It will grow more
  sources and reasons later, so both must grow without a redesign.
- The first version covers notifications, pull requests that request the viewer's review, the
  viewer's own pull requests, and pull requests assigned to the viewer.
- Notifications cover pull requests, issues, releases, check suites, discussions, and more. Their
  payload has a title, type, and REST URL, but no node ID. Check suite notifications have no URL.
- GitHub search cannot express some reasons, such as merge conflicts.
- Rules that need GitHub to test are slow to test and hard to change.

## Options considered

- One search query per reason, so GitHub does the filtering. Rejected: some reasons cannot be
  searched, and the rules would live in query strings that tests cannot check without GitHub.
- Sources and rules in config from the start. Deferred: the basic sources come first, and the
  structure below lets config add them later without a redesign.
- User-written rule code loaded at runtime. Deferred: it needs a plugin contract and a trust model.
- Sources as a list that returns candidates, and named local rules over plain facts. Chosen: sources
  and rules each grow by adding an entry, and the rules run in tests without GitHub.

## Decision

Sources decide which subjects Zeta fetches. Rules in `work` decide why each one needs action.

### Sources

- A source has a name and finds candidate subjects. The first sources are unread notifications and
  three pull request searches: `review-requested:@me`, `author:@me`, and `assignee:@me`, each open
  only.
- A subject found by several sources becomes one item.
- Sources are one list in `github`. Adding a source means adding an entry.

### Identity

- An item's identity is its host, repository, subject type, and number or ID, such as a pull request
  number or release ID.
- A notification without a subject URL, such as a check suite, uses its thread ID as its identity.

### Rules

- A rule has a stable ID and a pure function from the facts of one item to a reason or none.
- `work` holds the rules as one list. Adding a reason means adding an entry, not changing callers.
- Rules read facts, not which source found the item. "Review requested" checks the review requests,
  so the result does not depend on how the sources overlap.
- An unread notification is a reason by itself, with GitHub's notification reason as its detail.
- A candidate with no reason is not shown.

### Facts

- `work` owns the facts type. `github` fills it from responses. Rules never see GraphQL or REST
  shapes.
- Facts for a subject type that Zeta cannot look up in a batch, such as a check suite, stay at what
  the notification payload holds.
- A rule that needs a new fact adds it to the facts type and to the query in the same change.

## Tradeoffs

- New sources and reasons need no change to the session, UI, or transport.
- Every rule runs in unit tests with plain fact values.
- Cost: every refresh fetches every fact any rule reads.
- Cost: items of subject types without detail lookups show only a title and a type.
- Cost: changing a source or rule still needs a code change until config supports it.
- Cost: each search is capped by GitHub search limits.
